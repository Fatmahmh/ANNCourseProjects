### Artificial neural networks course projects  ( Python ) :  Word Clustering using SOMs ,Relation Classification Using Multilayer Perceptron

-1. Word Clustering using SOMs 
• A self-organizing map is built from scratch by using NumPy and Math and Random to group the words  into clusters
 
-2. Relation Classification Using Multilayer Perceptron 
• Relation Classification Using Multilayer Perceptron with the GloVe word embeddings which were built from scratch in Python by using NumPy and Pandas and Random.
